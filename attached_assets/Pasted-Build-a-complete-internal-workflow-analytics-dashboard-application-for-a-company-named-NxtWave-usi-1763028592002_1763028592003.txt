Build a complete internal workflow + analytics dashboard application for a company named NxtWave using:

React + TypeScript + Vite

Supabase (Auth + DB)

Static seed data for demo

React-Toastify for notifications

Chart.js for analytics

Professional UI with ONLY solid colors (no gradients)

Vercel V0-compatible component structure

Role-based workflow: Employee → Manager → Director → CEO

📌 BUSINESS CONTEXT

NxtWave has 3 products:

NIAT

Intensive

Academy

Each product has multiple departments, each department has one manager.
Employees belong to one department but may work across multiple products.

We want to automate contribution reporting and approval workflow that currently happens manually in sheets.

📌 FEATURES TO BUILD
1. Employee Contribution Form

Employee logs in via Supabase Auth.

Form shows checkboxes: NIAT, Intensive, Academy.

Selecting a product dynamically shows departments under that product.

For each selected product:

Department dropdown

Contribution percentage input

Total contribution % must = 100.

On submit:

Save to employee_contributions

Status = "submitted_to_manager"

Show Toastify success/error.

2. Manager Dashboard

Manager logs in.

Sees employees only from their department.

Can approve or reject submissions.

Approve → "approved_by_manager"

Reject (with comment) → "rejected_by_manager"

Toastify for actions.

3. Director Dashboard

Directors see manager-approved submissions.

Can approve or reject.

Approve → "approved_by_director"

4. CEO Dashboard (Chart.js)

Use solid color palette only (NO gradients).

Charts required:

Product-wise contribution pie chart

Department-wise bar chart

Approval-status donut chart

Monthly trend line chart (static data)

Cards for top contributors
